# How to Contribute to CloudnetPy

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :+1:

Reporting bugs
--------------

* Create a new [issue](https://github.com/tukiains/cloudnetpy/issues)
* Describe the problem and steps to reproduce it
* Suggest a fix if you can but this is not mandatory

Proposing code improvements
---------------------------

If you have a good idea how to improve the code without changing the actual outcome
of the processing, you can directly create a [pull request](https://github.com/tukiains/cloudnetpy/pulls) (PR). 
Examples of these kind of changes are, for example, better 

* unit tests
* implementations of the helper functions
* docstrings

Try to keep your pull requests small. This will increase the chance to be accepted.

Proposing new features
----------------------

Changes that would alter the actual outcome of the processing need to be carefully
reviewed and tested before accepting. Examples include, for example, modifications in the

* methodology (e.g. replacing the wet bulb method with a newer version)
* threshold values used in different functions / methods
* constant values

Also for these sort of proposals, you can open a new [issue](https://github.com/tukiains/cloudnetpy/issues)
where the idea can be discussed before (possible) implementation.
