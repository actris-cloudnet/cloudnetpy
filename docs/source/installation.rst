Installation Instructions
=========================

CloudnetPy can be installed on any computer supporting Python3.6 (or higher).
The actual installation procedure depends on the operating system. The
instructions below are for Ubuntu, although they work with
many other Linux systems as well.

Python Installation
-------------------

These instructions are for the current stable Python release, Python3.7:

.. code-block:: console
		
   $ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
   $ sudo apt install python3.7 python3.7-venv python3-pip

Virtual Environment
-------------------

Create a new virtual environment and activate it:

.. code-block:: console
		
   $ python3.7 -m venv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate


Pip-based Installation
----------------------

CloudnetPy is available from Python Package Index, `PyPI
<https://pypi.org/project/cloudnetpy/>`_.
Use Python's package manager, `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_,
to install CloudnetPy package into the virtual environment:

.. code-block:: console
		
   (venv)$ pip3 install cloudnetpy

CloudnetPy is now ready for use from that virtual environment.

.. note::

   CloudnetPy codebase is rapidly developing and the PyPI package does not
   necessarily contain all the latest features and modifications. To get an up-to-date
   version of CloudnetPy, download it directly from `GitHub
   <https://github.com/tukiains/cloudnetpy>`_.
