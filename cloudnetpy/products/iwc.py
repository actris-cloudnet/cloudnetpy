    """Generates Cloudnet ice water content product.

    This function calculates ice water content using the so-called Z-T method.
    In this method, ice water content is calculated from attenuated-corrected
    radar reflectivity and model temperature. The results are written in a
    netCDF file.

    Args:
    ----
        categorize_file: Categorize file name.
        output_file: Output file name.
        uuid: Set specific UUID for the file.

    Returns:
    -------
        UUID of the generated file.

    Examples:
    --------
        >>> from cloudnetpy.products import generate_iwc
        >>> generate_iwc('categorize.nc', 'iwc.nc')
